# Lets Keep Running

## Milestone 1 Project: User Centric Frontend Development by Martin Johnson


This is a fictious running club designed to attract B2C users to join up and use the training plans on offer.

## User experience

A simple to follow layout, on all devices,  displaying a brief description about the club, testimonials from members, training plans , links to partner and associate clubs 
and a members gallery page.

## Strategy

To create a simple and attractive site for runners of all levels of ability and offer 
an opportunity to join the club and use the training plans provided

## Scope

To provide a brief history of the club , supported by member testimonials. To display a 
selection of training plans, links to associate running clubs and a members gallery.

## Structure

The site is designed to provide an instant opportunity to join the club from the landing 
page and an additional option to join the club from the plans section.
The site is easily navigated from the Navigation menu at the top of the page.

## Skelton

The initial design layout was created using Figma.

## Surface

An image of runners was chosen for the landing page , with a opacity added to
enable the text to be more visible. The font chosen was Roboto and a basic blue colur scheme 
for the Navigation Bar and section headings has been used

## Technologies

1. HTML -  For website structure
2. CSS -  For styling. 
3. Bootstrap - To assist and improve the layout of the site, including grids , styles,
lists, forms, navbars and a modal function
4. Figma - For the initail design layout

## Features

**Navigation Bar :**  Allows users to navigate to all sections of the site in a simply manner
and return to the Home page from any page

**Hero Image :** The Hero image shows a running event with a zoom effect , additionally a call to action button invites users 
to join the club immediately

**About and Testimonial sections:** Provides a brief summary about the formation of the club and its running ideologies. The testimonials display positive feedback from members

**Plans:** This displays another call to action button to invite users to join the site
and a selection of training plans that are selected via check boxes

**Sign Up Modal:** A modal pop up box is triggered when a user clicks on either sign up button to 
allow them to enter personal details and sign up to the club.

**Clubs:**  Provides working links to running based websites

**Gallery:** Displays members images

**Footer:**  Displays club address and contact number and linkds to social media sites.

## Future Implimentations

Connect modal pop-up to a live database to capture new user details

Add a sign in function / button with validation to check whether users are current members

Add functionality to restrict non members from selecting plans

Add functionality to allow plans to be ordered. (Order Button to be added) 

## Testing 

All links to outside sites are functional and working.  The site has been tested on mobile, tablet and large screen devices for compatabity and functionality

validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input was used to check the HTML and was error free

jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator was used to check the CSS with no errors. One warning message was reported stating that imported stylesheets are not checked

Chrome Dev Tools were used to test styling issues before code was upodated . An additional test.html file was used during coding to 
understand the changes HTML and CSS code had on the index.html during coding. This test file was subsequently deleted when coding was finished

## Bugs and issues

An issue with the modal pop up effecting the layout on mobile devices was found during the design stage. This appeared to be due to the modal coding being placed inside a code section.
Once the modal coding was placed outside of the screen layout code the issue was resolved.
The site was initailly slow to load and was improved by moving the Gallery section to a new file (gallery.html), however links to  the Home page do appear to be a little slower to loads than other links. Further investigation is required ro resolve this.
On mobile devices the Nav Bar pop up menu obscures some headings when the links are selected.  Again further investigation is required but timeframes for project submission have not allowed this

## Deployment

The site is hosted in a GitHub repository
The  URL for the site is https://martinjohnson26.github.io/Milestone1/

The site was developed on GitPod and changes regularly committed to GitHub's repository
using one main master branch

## Credits

**Content:** The inspiration for the site came from my own passion for running and transition from novice runner to a sub 2 hour Half marathoner.
The code has been written by myself with the exception of the Modal function. This was copied from https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_modal&stacked=h 
and modified by myself to meet the needs of the site
